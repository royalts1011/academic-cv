abstract: Past medical research has shown that infantile movement and early neurological development are closely linked. Fidgety Movements are reflex-like movements occurring in healthy infants less than 20-weeks of age, and their absence is strongly correlated with the future development of neurological disorders like Cerebral Palsy. To provide timely intervention, the General Movement Assessment was proposed as a screening medical procedure. We conducted a study using deep learning approaches to learn disentangled feature representations for the recognition of Fidgety Movements using RGB-D video and Inertial Measurement Unit data acquired from 95 infants. Our results show that while it is possible to learn features that characterize movement independently of subject information, obtaining feature representations that consistently generalize to subjects unseen during training remains challenging.

summary: Machine learning study on fidgety movement recognition using vision and inertial sensors for early detection of neurological disorders.
